    <p>Sport pertains to any form of competitive physical activity or game
        that aims to use, maintain, or improve physical ability and skills 
        while providing enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, entertainment 
        to spectators. Sports can, through casual or organized participation, improve participants' 
        physical health. <strong>Hundreds of sports exist</strong>, from those between single contestants, 
        through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, 
        either in teams or competing as individuals. </p>
        <p>In certain sports such as racing, 
        many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner; 
        in others, the contest <em>(a match)</em> is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. 
        Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; others provide 
        tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of contests 
        may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion</p>
    <h2>Types of Sports</h2>
    <p>There are many different types of sports that are enjoyed by people all around the world.</p>

    <section id="Basketball">
        <h2>Basketball</h2>
        <p>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another 
            on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches 
            (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m)
             high to a backboard at each end of the court, while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. 
             </p>
           <p>A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three.
            After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, 
              two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation 
              play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated. </p>

        <h2>LawnTennis</h2>
        <p>Tennis is a racket sport that is played either individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung 
            with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the opponent is not 
            able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball validly will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.</p>
